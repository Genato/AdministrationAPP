# AdministrationApp
Application for company administration

This is pure hoby project for learning WPF, .NET, ADO.NET, etc..... So if you don't understand something or code is not readble or there is bad logic, please have in mind that am still learning...

App is standard WPF project template, atm there are few thing added(LicenceChecker class, project HelperClass - library for helper classes like DB handling, hashing etc...)

Atm am working on Java Web_App project, so this is currently on wait.
